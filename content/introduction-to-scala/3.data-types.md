# Data Types in Scala

Like most programming languages out there, Scala has multiple data types.

Every data type is a class, making every variable an instance of a class.

## Built-in Data Types

Let us look into some built-in data types available in Scala.

### Numeric Types

```scala
val x: Byte = 1; // Byte
val x: Int = 12; // Integer
val x: Long = 12; // Long Integer
val x: Short = 12; // Short Integer
val x: Double = 12.0; // Double Precision Number
val x: Float = 12.0; // Floating Point Number
```

Of these types, `Int`{lang="scala"} and `Double`{lang="scala"} are the default
numeric data types that do not need explicit annotation.

```scala
val x = 1; // Int
val x = 1.0; // Double
```

You can also omit annotation for some other numeric data types by appending
a certain character to the value itself.

```scala
val x = 7L; // Long
val x = 7.0F; // Floating
val x = 7.0D; // Double
```

### Characters and Strings

Characters are denoted by single quotes (eg. `'C'`) and strings are denoted
by double quotes (eg. `"C"`).

```scala
val x = "foo"; // String
val x = 'f' // Char
```

Multiline strings can be created using three double quotes. However, stripping the indents is your job.

```scala
val x = """
           Water
           Is
           Good
        """
```

### The Unit Type

`Unit` is a type similar to `void` in many other languages.

### Union & Intersection

Union types are represented using `Type1 | Type2`.

Intersection types are represented using `Type1 & Type2`.
