# Control Structures in Scala

Scala provides a bunch of control structures for controlling the flow of the program.

- `if/else` expressions (not statements).
- `match` expressions.
- `while` loops.
- `for` expressions (again, not just looping statements).
- `try/catch` expressions.

**What is the difference between an *expression* and a *statement*?**

An expression is something that returns a result. eg. `1 + 2`{lang="ts"}. This returns 
an actual result, `3`{lang="ts"}.

A statement, however, need not return a result. eg. `c = 1 + 2`{lang="ts"}. This simply
assigns the result of the expression to `c` and does not return any result.

## The `if/else` Construct

Here we have our traditional selection statement, `if`{lang="ts"}, but as an expression. In other words,
the `if`{lang="ts"} statement always returns a result.

### Plain `if` Construct

The `if`{lang="ts"} construct can be used to run a block depending on a condition.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}
 ```scala
  object ControlStructures {
    def main(args: Array[String]) = {
      val onePiece = true;
      if (onePiece == true) { 
        println("The One Piece is real!");
      }
  }
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}
 ```scala
  @main def ControlStructures() = 
    val onePiece = true;
    if onePiece == true then 
      println("The One Piece is real!");
 ```
 :::
::

### The `if/else` Construct

`if`{lang="ts"} blocks can be accompanied with a fallback `else`{lang="ts"} block.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}
 ```scala
  object ControlStructures {
    def main(args: Array[String]) = {
      val onePiece = true;
      if (onePiece == true) { 
        println("The One Piece is real!");
      } else {
        println("The One Piece is not real!");
      }
  }
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}
 ```scala
  @main def ControlStructures() = 
    val onePiece = true;
    if onePiece == true then 
      println("The One Piece is real!");
    else
      println("The One Piece is not real!");
 ```
 :::
::

### The `else-if` Ladder

`else`{lang="ts"} blocks can contain another `if`{lang="ts"} block as a lone child. This
can create a ladder of `if-else-if`{lang="ts"} expressions.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}
 ```scala
  object ControlStructures {
    def main(args: Array[String]) = {
      val onePiece = 1;
      if (onePiece == 1) { 
        println("The One Piece is real!");
      } else if (onePiece == 0) {
        println("The One Piece is not real!");
      } else {
        println("The One Piece is a mystery!");
      }
  }
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}
 ```scala
  @main def ControlStructures() = 
    val onePiece = 1;
    if onePiece == 1 then
      println("The One Piece is real!");
    else if onePiece == 0 then
      println("The One Piece is not real!");
    else
      println("The One Piece is a mystery!");
 ```

### Expression-Oriented Programming

But where does the **expression** part kick in? 

::Alert{type="info"}
*Exclusive usage of expressions in programming is called **Expression-Oriented Programming**.*
::


If you have used C or JavaScript, you would be familiar with the concept of ternaries,
expressions that return a result based on a condition. If you have used Python or Rust,
Scala's `if`{lang="ts"} expression would be an easy thing.

Let us rewrite our `if/else`{lang="ts"} code to utilise this nature of the `if`{lang="ts"} construct.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}
 ```scala
  object ControlStructures {
    def main(args: Array[String]) = {
      val onePiece = true;
      println(s"The One Piece is ${if (onePiece == true) "" else "not "}real!");
  }
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}
 ```scala
  @main def ControlStructures() = 
    val onePiece = true; 
    println(s"The One Piece is ${if (onePiece == true) then "" else "not "}real!");
 ```
 :::
::

`if (onePiece == true) "" else "not "`{lang="scala"} adds a `"not "`{lang="ts"} depending
on whether `onePiece` is false.

This prints `"The One Piece is real!"`{lang="ts"}.

## `match` Expressions

`match`{lang="rust"} is similar to `switch`{lang="ts"} in languages like C, Java, and JavaScript.
However, `match`{lang="rust"} is actually an expression, unlike `switch`{lang="ts"}, a statement.

Let us rewrite our [else-if ladder](#the-else-if-ladder) code to use a match construct.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}
 ```scala
  val onePiece = 1;
  onePiece match {
    case 1 => println("The One Piece is real!")
    case 0 => println("The One Piece is not real!")
    case _ => println("The One Piece is a mystery!")
  }
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}
 ```scala
  val onePiece = 1;
  onePiece match
    case 1 => println("The One Piece is real!")
    case 0 => println("The One Piece is not real!")
    case _ => println("The One Piece is a mystery!")
 ```
 :::
::

You can also make it match a certain pattern, like a type.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}
 ```scala
  val onePiece = "1";
  onePiece match {
    case op: Int => println("The One Piece is an integer!")
    case op: String => println("The One Piece is a string!")
    case _ => println("The One Piece is a mystery!")
  }
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}
 ```scala
  val onePiece = 1;
  onePiece match
    case op: Int => println("The One Piece is an integer!")
    case op: String => println("The One Piece is a string!")
    case _ => println("The One Piece is a mystery!")
 ```
 :::
::

And as always, `match`{lang="rust"} is an expression, so you can assign the
result of a `match`{lang="rust"} expression to a variable.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}
 ```scala
  val onePiece = 1;
  val result = onePiece match {
    case 1 => "The One Piece is real!"
    case 0 => "The One Piece is not real!"
    case _ => "The One Piece is a mystery!"
  };
  println(result);
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}
 ```scala
  val onePiece = 1;
  val result = onePiece match
    case 1 => "The One Piece is real!"
    case 0 => "The One Piece is not real!"
    case _ => "The One Piece is a mystery!"
  println(result);
 ```
 :::
::

`match`{lang="rust"} expressions can also be used with **case classes**. We
will see them in detail in a later article.

## The `while` Loop

The `while`{lang="ts"} loop is a loop that runs a block of code as long as a
given condition remains valid.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}
 ```scala
  var notFifteen = 1;
  while(notFifteen != 15) {
    notFifteen = notFifteen + 1;
  }
  println("notFifteen is now fifteen");
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}
 ```scala
  var notFifteen = 1;
  while 
    notFifteen != 15 
  do 
    notFifteen = notFifteen + 1;
  println("notFifteen is now fifteen");
 ```
 :::
::

The loop terminates when the test condition (`notFiften != 15`{lang="ts"}) becomes false.

::Alert{type="warning"}
*The `do {} while ()`{lang="ts"} loop exists in Scala 2. However, it is deprecated and should be avoided.*
::

## The `for` Construct

`for`{lang="ts"} loops have been a widely-used, yet highly redundant feature in languages like **C** where they seemed to be
no more than a `while`{lang="ts"} loop with less boilerplate.

`for`{lang="ts"} loops in Scala are actually expressions and they follow the function of these loops in languages like Rust
and Python.

They are used to iterate over collections. In this article, we shall use them to iterate over `ranges` of integers.

### The `for` Loop

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}
 ```scala
  println("Counting...");
  for (n <- 0 until 100) {
    println(n);
  }
  println("The end.");
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}
 ```scala
  println("Counting...");
  for n <- 0 until 100 do
    println(n);
  println("The end.");
 ```
 :::
::

In the above code, we are iterating through a range. We will see about ranges in a later article.

::Alert{type="info"}
  *You can create an **inclusive** loop using `to` instead of `until`.*
  ```scala
  val n = 0 until 5; // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  val m = 0 to 5; // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  ```
::

You can also add a condition to make it skip some iterations. For example,
the below code prints all **EVEN** numbers from 0 until 100.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}
 ```scala
  println("Counting...");
  // print only if n % 2 is 0
  for (n <- 0 until 100 if n % 2 == 0) {
    println(n);
  }
  println("The end.");
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}
 ```scala
  println("Counting...");
  // print only if n % 2 is 0
  for n <- 0 until 100 if n % 2 == 0 do
    println(n);
  println("The end.");
 ```
 :::
::

These conditions are called **guards**.

### `for` Loops As Expressions

You can use `for`{lang="ts"} loops as expressions by using the `yield`{lang="ts"} keyword.

The `yield`{lang="ts"} keyword collects the result of each iteration and returns an `Indexed Sequence`
of results.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}
 ```scala
  val evenNumbers = for (n <- 0 until 100 if n % 2 == 0) yield n;
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}
 ```scala
  val evenNumbers = for n <- 0 until 100 if n % 2 == 0 yield n;
 ```
 :::
::

The value of `evenNumbers`{lang="ts"} will be `IndexedSeq(0, 2, 4, 6... 98)`{lang="scala"}.
