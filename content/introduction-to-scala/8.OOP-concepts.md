# OOP Concepts in Scala

As mentioned in the introduction, Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.

Like many other object-oriented languages, Scala provides `classes`. In addition, Scala also provides
`traits`.

## Traits

Traits are like `interfaces`, but can also define concrete methods and properties.

```scala
trait Baddie;
```

### Abstract Methods and Properties

Traits can define abstract members that are required to be implemented
by any subclass.

The following is a simple example of a purely interface-like trait,
providing only abstract methods:

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}

```scala
 trait Pillager {
   val target: String
   def pillage: String
 }
 class Pirate extends Pillager {
   def target = "other ships"
   def pillage = "The pirate pillages " + target
 }
```

:::

:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}

```scala
 trait Pillager:
   val target: String
   def pillage: String

 class Pirate extends Pillager:
   def target = "other ships"
   def pillage = "The pirate pillages " + target
```

:::
::

### Concrete Methods and Properties

Traits can also provide concrete methods and properties, basically members provided
to the subclass by the trait.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}

```scala
 trait Pillager {
   val name: String;
   val target = "innocent people"
   def pillage = s"The $name pillages $target"
 }
 class Bandit extends Pillager {
   val name = "bandit"
 }
```

:::

:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}

```scala
 trait Pillager:
   val name: String;
   val target = "innocent people"
   def pillage = s"The $name pillages $target"

 class Bandit extends Pillager:
   val name = "bandit"
```

:::
::

### Mixin Composition

A class (or trait) can also extend multiple traits to combine multiple behaviors.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}

```scala
 trait Pillager {
   val target: String
   def pillage: String
 }
 trait Sailor {
   def sail = "They sail"
 }
 class Pirate extends Pillager with Sailor {
   def target = "other ships"
   def pillage = "The pirate pillages " + target
 }
```

:::

:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}

```scala
 trait Pillager:
   val target: String
   def pillage: String

 trait Sailor:
   def sail = "They sail"

 class Pirate extends Pillager, Sailor:
   def target = "other ships"
   def pillage = "The pirate pillages " + target
```

## Classes

Classes are blueprints for objects. They can also extend traits or other classes (or both).

While a class can extend multiple traits, it can only extend one class. It is advisable to
use traits over classes for decomposition.

Let's rewrite our previous example to use only classes.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}

```scala
 // superclass
 class Pillager(val name: String) {
   val target = "innocent people"
   def pillage = s"The $name pillages $target"
 }
 // derived subclass
 class Bandit extends Pillager("bandit");
```

:::

:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}

```scala
 // superclass
 class Pillager(val name: String):
   val target = "innocent people"
   def pillage = s"The $name pillages $target"

 // derived subclass
 class Bandit extends Pillager("bandit");
```

:::
::

In this example, `Pillager` is the superclass from which the `Bandit` subclass is derived.

Classes can have a constructor which helps initialize values.

```scala
// Pirate is a class with one parameter, name: String
// The `val` implies that the parameter is stored
// as a property of the Pirate class.
class Pirate(val name: String)

// teach is an instance of Pirate with the name Blackbeard
val teach = new Pirate("Blackbeard")
```

## Abstract Classes

Abstract classes are similar to traits but with one big difference:

-   Code with `traits` cannot be called from Java code.

Abstract classes are capable of operating with Java.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}

```scala
 abstract class Pillager(val name: String) {
   def target: String
   def pillage = s"The $name pillages $target"
 }
 // derived subclass
 class Bandit extends Pillager("bandit") {
   val target = "innocent people"
 }
```

:::

:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}

```scala
 abstract class Pillager(val name: String):
   def target: String
   def pillage = s"The $name pillages $target"

 // derived subclass
 class Bandit extends Pillager("bandit") {
   val target = "innocent people"
 }
```

## Implicit Classes and Extension Methods

Imagine you didn't have to explicitly construct a class to use it.

Seems convenient, yet scary, right? 

Implicit classes were used in Scala 2 to add more methods to existing data types.

::CodeGroup
:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}

```scala
object stuff {
    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
        "steve".mine
        // steve is automatically converted into a player
    }
    implicit class Player(name: String) {
        def mine = println(s"${name} mines!")
    }
}
```
:::
::

Scala 3 provides `extension` methods that can work on existing data types.

::CodeGroup
:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3" active}

```scala
extension (name: String)
    def mine = println(s"${name} mines!")

@main def stuff(args: Array[String]): Unit = "steve".mine
```
:::

## Case Classes

Case classes are similar to regular classes, with more features:

- All case classes have an `apply` and `unapply` method.

This means, they can be constructed without a `new` keyword and
can be destroyed using a `match` expression.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}

```scala
val origin = Coordinates(83, 10, 23)
origin match {
    case Coordinates(x, y, z) => println(s"The altitude is ${y}!")
}
// CASE CLASSES HAVE
// BUILT-IN EXTRACTOR
case class Coordinates(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int)
```

:::

:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}

```scala
val origin = Coordinates(83, 10, 23)
origin match
    case Coordinates(x, y, z) => println(s"The altitude is ${y}!")
// CASE CLASSES HAVE
// BUILT-IN EXTRACTOR
case class Coordinates(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int)
```

:::

## Case Objects

Case objects are like case classes, but cannot be constructed.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}

```scala
trait Flavor;

case object ButterScotch extends Flavor
case object Chocolate extends Flavor
case object Vanilla extends Flavor

object stuff {
    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
        val flavor: Flavor = Chocolate
        flavor match {
            case ButterScotch => println("Tis yellow")
            case Chocolate => println("Tis bitter")
            case Vanilla => println("Tis heavenly")
        }
    }
}
```

:::

:::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}

```scala
trait Flavor;

case object ButterScotch extends Flavor
case object Chocolate extends Flavor
case object Vanilla extends Flavor

@main def stuff(): Unit =
    val flavor: Flavor = Chocolate
    flavor match 
        case ButterScotch => println("Tis yellow")
        case Chocolate => println("Tis bitter")
        case Vanilla => println("Tis heavenly")
```
