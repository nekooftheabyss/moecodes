# Functions in Scala

In Scala 2, every class / object can contain its own methods. In Scala 3, these methods can
exist outside objects and classes and are called functions.

::Alert{type="info"}
*Functions in programming are like functions in math. They evaluate an expression and return a result.*

*Functions are normally used to break large programs into smaller modules and improve reusability.*
::

The syntax of a simple function / method looks like this:

```scala
def methodName(param1: Type1, param2: Type2): ReturnType = {
  // function body
}
```

Functions need not have parameters or return values:

```scala
def helloWorld = println("Hello, World!")
```

You can return a value from the function either through an expression or by explicitly
using the `return`{lang="ts"} keyword.

```scala
def helloWorld(): String = "Hello, World!"
```

```scala
def giveMeOne(): Int = {
  return 1
}
```

Functions can have as many parameters as required.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}
 ```scala
  def helloWorld(times: Int) = {
    for (i <- 0 until times) {
      println("Hello, World!");
    }
  }
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}
 ```scala
  def helloWorld(times: Int) = {
    for i <- 0 until times do {
      println("Hello, World!");
    }
  }
 ```

And as always, functions can return a value after evaluation.
In the below example, `helloWorld` returns an `IndexedSeq`{lang="scala"}
containing as many "Hello, World!" as required.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala 2;Scala 3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 2" active}
 ```scala
def helloWorld(times: Int): IndexedSeq[String] = {
  for (i <- 0 until times) yield {
    "Hello, World!"
  }
}
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala 3"}
 ```scala
def helloWorld(times: Int): IndexedSeq[String] = {
  for i <- 0 until times do yield {
    "Hello, World!"
  }
}
 ```
