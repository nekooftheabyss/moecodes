# Doubly Linked-List

::Alert{type="gray"}
*This article assumes that you have already read [Linked-List in C](/l/c/single-linked-list) and does not provide much explanation.*
::

## Linked-List structure

A doubly linked-list is made up of a number of **nodes**, each node typically having two parts:

-   The **data** part that stores the actual data.
-   The **link** part that stores the address of the previous and next nodes in the linked-list.

```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
    struct Node *previous;
};
```

In this example, our **data** is a normal C integer. However, your linked-list can store whatever type of data you want, depending on
your implementation.

Now that we have our struct ready, let's initialize the **head** of the linked-list, a pointer that points to the first element in the
linked-list.

```c
struct Node *HEAD;
```

Cool. Now let's move on to the next part. That is, adding an item to our linked-list. Let us first try inserting an element
in the linked-list.

## Insertion

### Insert At Beginning

```c
void insert_at_beginning(int item) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item;
    new_item->next = NULL;
}
```

We have two cases when it comes to insertion at the beginning:
1. The list is empty. In this case, we just place the element there and... the end.
```c
if (HEAD == NULL) {
    HEAD = new_item;
}
```

2. There is at least one element in the list. In this case, we are assigning our existing first item
to a temporary variable and inserting our new item in that position instead.
```c
if (HEAD == NULL) {
    HEAD = new_item;
} else {
    struct Node *temp = HEAD;
    HEAD = new_item;
    HEAD->next = temp;
    temp->previous = HEAD;
}
```

The only change from our **singly linked-list** is the `previous` pointer to which we need to assign
the previous element's pointer.

Our complete function looks like this:

```c
void insert_at_beginning(int item_to_insert) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item_to_insert;
    new_item->next = NULL;
    // Assign `previous` as `NULL`
    new_item->previous = NULL;

    if (HEAD == NULL) {
        HEAD = new_item;
    } else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        HEAD = new_item;
        HEAD->next = temp;
        // Make former first node point to new node
        temp->previous = HEAD;
    }
}
```

And that's it, for our `insert_at_beginning()`{lang="c"}. 

### Insert At End

Inserting at the end of a doubly linked-list has one extra step compared to the 
singly linked-list:
- Assigning the predecessor's address to the `previous` field of our new node.

Our complete function looks like this:

```c
void insert_at_end(int item_to_insert) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item_to_insert;
    new_item->next = NULL;
    new_item->previous = NULL;

    if (HEAD == NULL) {
        HEAD = new_item;
    } else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        while (temp->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        temp->next = new_item;
        // Assign former last node as `previous`
        new_item->previous = temp;
    }
}
```

### Insert At Custom Position

Unlike the singly-linked list, we now have to consider both the node's successor
and the predecessor. The predecessor should have its `next` pointer point to our
new node. The successor should have its `previous` pointer point to our new node.

Our complete function looks like this:

```c
void insert_at_custom(int item_to_insert, int position) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item_to_insert;
    new_item->next = NULL;

    if (HEAD == NULL) {
        HEAD = new_item;
    }
    struct Node *temp = HEAD;
    int i = 0; 
    while (i < position && temp->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
            i += 1;
    }
    new_item->next = temp->next;
    temp->next = new_item;
    
    // New node's successor's `previous` should point to new node.
    new_item->next->previous = new_item;
    // New node's `previous` should point to predecessor.
    new_item->previous = temp;
}
```

## Deletion

Let's go through different cases we could have for deletion.

### Deletion From End

Deletion from the end in a doubly linked-list is no different from a singly linked-list 
because the `previous` pointer of the last node just does not matter.

```c
void delete_from_end() {
    if (HEAD == NULL)
        return;
    else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        while (temp->next->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        struct Node *last = temp->next;
        temp->next = NULL;
        free(last);
    }
}
```

### Deletion From Beginning

Deletion from the beginning has one small change compared to the singly linked-list.

```c
HEAD = HEAD->next;
// Make the `previous` pointer point to NULL
HEAD->previous = NULL;
```

Our complete function looks like this:
```c
void delete_from_beginning() {
    if (HEAD == NULL)
        return;
    else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        HEAD = HEAD->next;
        // Make the `previous` pointer point to NULL
        HEAD->previous = NULL;
        free(temp);
    }
}
```
### Deletion From Custom Position

The only change from the singly linked-list version is that we need to make the deleted node's
successor's `previous` pointer point to the deleted node's predecessor.

Our complete function looks like this:

```c
void delete_from_custom(int position) {
    if (HEAD == NULL)
        return;
    struct Node *temp = HEAD;
    int i = 0;
    while (i < position - 1 && temp->next->next != NULL) {
        temp = temp->next;
        i += 1;
    }
    struct Node *last = temp->next;
    temp->next = last->next;
    // Make the deleted node's successor point to its predecessor
    temp->next->previous = temp;
    free(last);
}
```

The working is the same as `delete_from_end()`{lang="c"} except that we modify the connections 
in a different way.

## What We Have Now

```c 
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
    struct Node *previous;
};

struct Node *HEAD;

void insert_at_end(int item_to_insert) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item_to_insert;
    new_item->next = NULL;
    new_item->previous = NULL;

    if (HEAD == NULL) {
        HEAD = new_item;
    } else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        while (temp->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        temp->next = new_item;
        new_item->previous = temp;
    }
}

void insert_at_beginning(int item_to_insert) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item_to_insert;
    new_item->next = NULL;
    new_item->previous = NULL;

    if (HEAD == NULL) {
        HEAD = new_item;
    } else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        HEAD = new_item;
        HEAD->next = temp;
        temp->previous = HEAD;
    }
}

void insert_at_custom(int item_to_insert, int position) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item_to_insert;
    new_item->next = NULL;

    if (HEAD == NULL) {
        HEAD = new_item;
    }
    struct Node *temp = HEAD;
    int i = 0; 
    while (i < position && temp->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
            i += 1;
    }
    new_item->next = temp->next;
    temp->next = new_item;

    new_item->next->previous = new_item;
    new_item->previous = temp;
}

void delete_from_end() {
    if (HEAD == NULL)
        return;
    else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        while (temp->next->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        struct Node *last = temp->next;
        temp->next = NULL;
        free(last);
    }
}

void delete_beginning() {
    if (HEAD == NULL)
        return;
    else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        HEAD = HEAD->next;
        HEAD->previous = NULL;
        free(temp);
    }
}

void delete_custom(int position) {
    if (HEAD == NULL)
        return;
    struct Node *temp = HEAD;
    int i = 0;
    while (i < position - 1 && temp->next->next != NULL) {
        temp = temp->next;
        i += 1;
    }
    struct Node *last = temp->next;
    temp->next = last->next;
    temp->next->previous = temp;
    free(last);
}
```
