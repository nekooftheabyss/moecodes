# Queue
::Alert{type="gray"}
*This article assumes that you have already read [Linked-List in C](/l/c/single-linked-list) and does not provide much explanation.*
::

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) architecture. 
It is like how people stand in a queue to buy something. The first person who goes in is the
first person who buys the product and comes out.

## Structure
The structure is the same as a singly linked-list.

```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};
```

However, the queue involves two pointers, the `front` and the `rear`.

```c 
struct Node *FRONT;
struct Node *REAR;
```

New nodes are inserted at the rear and accessed from the front.


## What We Have
```c
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};

struct Node *FRONT;
struct Node *REAR;

void enqueue(int item_to_insert) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item_to_insert;
    new_item->next = NULL;

    if (REAR == NULL) {
        REAR = new_item;
        FRONT = new_item;
    } else {
        struct Node *temp = REAR;
        REAR = new_item;
        temp->next = REAR;
    }
}

void dequeue() {
    if (FRONT == NULL)
        return; // Return on empty queue
    else {
        struct Node *temp = FRONT;
        if(FRONT->next == NULL) {
            FRONT = NULL;
            REAR = NULL;
        }
        else {
            FRONT = FRONT->next;
            free(temp);
        }
    }
}

```
