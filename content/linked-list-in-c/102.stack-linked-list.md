# The Stack
::Alert{type="gray"}
*This article assumes that you have already read [Linked-List in C](/l/c/single-linked-list) and does not provide much explanation.*
::

A stack is a data structure where each element is stacked on top of the previous element. The last element pushed is the first element accessed.
It follows the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) architecture. In other words, you cannot access any element on the bottom without taking elements out of the top.

## Structure
The structure is the same as a singly linked-list.

```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};
```

Let's name the **head** of our stack as **TOP**.

```c 
struct Node *TOP;
```

## Operations
You can perform two operations on a stack:
- Pushing onto the stack
- Popping out of the stack

### Pushing Onto The Stack

Pushing to the stack is the same as `insert_at_beginning()`{lang="c"} from our singly linked-list.

```c
void push(int item_to_insert) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item_to_insert;
    new_item->next = NULL;

    if (TOP == NULL) {
        TOP = new_item;
    } else {
        struct Node *temp = TOP;
        TOP = new_item;
        TOP->next = temp;
    }
}
```

### Popping Out Of The Stack

Popping out of the stack is just... our very simple `delete_from_beginning()`{lang="c"} from 
our singly linked-list. 

```c
void pop() {
    if (TOP == NULL)
        return; // Return in case of underflow
    else {
        struct Node *temp = TOP;
        TOP = TOP->next;
        free(temp);
    }
}
```

## What We Have
```c
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};

struct Node *TOP;

void push(int item_to_insert) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item_to_insert;
    new_item->next = NULL;

    if (TOP == NULL) {
        TOP = new_item;
    } else {
        struct Node *temp = TOP;
        TOP = new_item;
        TOP->next = temp;
    }
}

void pop() {
    if (TOP == NULL)
        return; // Return in case of underflow
    else {
        struct Node *temp = TOP;
        TOP = TOP->next;
        free(temp);
    }
}

```
