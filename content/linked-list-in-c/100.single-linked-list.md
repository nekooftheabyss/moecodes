# Linked-List

::Alert{type="gray"}
*This article assumes that you already know a bit of C, at least about function calls.*
::

A **linked-list** is a type of **collection** where elements are stored in random memory.

How is it different from the other collections like arrays? To understand, let us look into what the **stack** and **heap** are.

## The Stack

A stack is a data structure where each element is stacked on top of the previous element. The last element pushed is the first element accessed.
Unlike arrays, you cannot access the rest of the stack.

What does this stack have to do with our collections?

All statically allocated variables are stored in the program's stack. If you have encountered errors when programming, you would have come across
what is called the **call stack**. This stack keeps track of all function calls. Whenever a function is called, all parameters and local variables
are **pushed** onto the stack. Once the function is complete, these values are **popped** from the stack.

What if the size of data is dynamic? What if you have an array of 100 integers and the user wants 101? The stack can only accomodate data whose size is **known at compile-time**. If the size itself is dynamic, the data is allocated into the **heap** instead.

## The Heap

The heap is a tree-like data structure. In this case, the heap keeps track of dynamically allocated memory.

In other words, when you want to dynamically allocate memory for something at run time, you request a certain amount of space in the memory.
The allocator looks for a spot in the heap that is big enough to hold your value, stores your data there, and returns a **pointer**.
The pointer is just the address of that particular location in memory.

---

So now that we know how the heap works, let's move on to why all of this matters.

In programming languages like **C**, **C++**, and **Rust** which deal with system concepts a lot, the stack and heap matter a lot.
In order to create a dynamic collection of elements, we need to be familiar with the stack and the heap.

## Linked-List structure

A linked-list is made up of a number of **nodes**, each node typically having two parts:

-   The **data** part that stores the actual data.
-   The **link** part that stores the address of the previous or next node in the linked-list.

```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};
```

In this example, our **data** is a normal C integer. However, your linked-list can store whatever type of data you want, depending on
your implementation.

The `next` field stores a pointer that points to another `struct Node`. Referencing `Node` within `Node` is a concept called **self-referencing**.

Now that we have our struct ready, let's initialize the **head** of the linked-list, a pointer that points to the first element in the
linked-list.

```c
struct Node *HEAD;
```

Cool. Now let's move on to the next part. That is, adding an item to our linked-list. Let us first try inserting an element
in the linked-list.

## Insertion

### Insert At Beginning

```c
void insert_at_beginning(int item) {

}
```

We have named our function `insert_at_beginning()`{lang="c"}. Pretty descriptive. We will pass the value to insert via the `item` parameter.

Now comes the cool part. To allocate data in the heap, we need a function called `malloc()`{lang="c"} that can be found in `<stdlib.h>`{lang="c"}.

```c
// Insert this at the top of your file
#include <stdlib.h>
```

Moving on to seeing our `malloc()`{lang="c"} function in action,

```c
void insert_at_beginning(int item) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
}
```

Translating the above code to something humane,

-   _Give me the pointer of `new_item`{lang="c"} (`struct Node *new_item`{lang="c"})._
-   _Allocate enough memory to house data as big as a `Node` (`malloc(sizeof(struct Node))`{lang="c"})._
-   _Cast it to the `struct Node *`{lang="c"} type (`(struct Node *)`{lang="c"})._

It's okay now. We are moving to more casual stuff.

```c
void insert_at_beginning(int item) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item;
    new_item->next = NULL;
}
```

If you are new to the pointer concept, the `->` symbol may be new to you.

The `->` operator does the same thing as the `.` operator -- Accessing the children of an element.
However, unlike the `.` operator, we use the `->` to work with pointers.
As you can see, our `new_item`{lang="c"} is a pointer to an actual node.

`NULL`{lang="c"} is a special, void-ish value provided by `<stdlib.h>`{lang="c"}. We are setting `new_item->next`{lang="c"} to `NULL`{lang="c"}
since there is no next element in the chain.

We have two cases when it comes to insertion at the beginning:
1. The list is empty. In this case, we just place the element there and... the end.
```c
if (HEAD == NULL) {
    HEAD = new_item;
}
```

2. There is at least one element in the list. In this case, we are assigning our existing first item
to a temporary variable and inserting our new item in that position instead.
```c
if (HEAD == NULL) {
    HEAD = new_item;
} else {
    struct Element *temp = HEAD;
    HEAD = new_item;
    HEAD->next = temp;
}
```

It goes like

```sql
HEAD = - -> A -> B -> C -> D ->
```

When we insert E in this list, 

```sql
HEAD = - ->
temp = - -> A -> B -> C -> D ->

HEAD = - -> E ->
temp = - -> A -> B -> C -> D ->

HEAD = - -> E -> A -> B -> C -> D ->
temp = -
```

Our complete function looks like this:

```c
void insert_at_beginning(int item) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item;
    new_item->next = NULL;
    if (HEAD == NULL) {
        HEAD = new_item;
    } else {
        struct Element *temp = HEAD;
        HEAD = new_item;
        HEAD->next = temp;
    }
}
```

And that's it, for our `insert_at_beginning()`{lang="c"}. 

### Insert At End

Insertion at the end (or tail) of the linked-list has one extra step. It looks the same as our 
`insert_at_beginning()`{lang="c"} for the first part:

```c
void insert_at_end(int item) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item;
    new_item->next = NULL;
    if (HEAD == NULL) {
        HEAD = new_item;
    }
}
```

But when our linked-list already has an element, we cannot follow the same process as the
`insert_at_beginning()`{lang="c"}. Instead, we are just going to place our new node after the last node
in the list.

```c
    struct Node *temp = HEAD;
    while (temp->next != NULL) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    temp->next = new_item;
```

With this, we are iterating through the list till we reach the last node (that is, a node without
a **next** node assuming nothing went wrong till now).

Our complete function looks like this:

```c
void insert_at_end(int item) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item;
    new_item->next = NULL;

    if (HEAD == NULL) {
        HEAD = new_item;
    } else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        while (temp->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        temp->next = new_item;
    }
}
```

### Insert At Custom Position

Inserting a node at a custom position is not really hard. In fact, it would be a faster
operation than inserting at the tail. For such an insertion, we need two parameters.

```c
void insert_at_custom(int item, int position) {}
```

The rest of the function is, of course the same as our `insert_at_end()`{lang="c"} for most part.

Look at this part from our `insert_at_end()`{lang="c"}. 

```c
while (temp->next != NULL) {
    temp = temp->next;
}
```

We are just going to tweak it so that it stops iterating when it reaches the
required position.

```c
int i = 0; 
while (i < position && temp->next != NULL) {
    temp = temp->next;
    i += 1;
}
```

That's it. But one tiny issue. Since our insertion probably happens at the middle of
the linked-list, inserting this node directly would severe the link to the rest of
the linked-list.

Let's just fix this.

```c
new_item->next = temp->next;
```

Now our link is complete.

Our complete function looks like this:

```c
void insert_at_custom(int item, int position) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->value = item;
    new_item->next = NULL;
    if (HEAD == NULL) {
        HEAD = new_item;
    } else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        int i = 0; 
        while (i < position && temp->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
            i += 1;
        }
        new_item->next = temp->next;
        temp->next = new_item;
    }
}
```

## Deletion

Deletion of a node from the linked-list means completely erasing that node from memory.
However, randomly deleting the node from memory would leave us with pointers pointing to
invalid memory. Such a pointer is called a dangling pointer.

Let's go through different cases we could have for deletion.

### Deletion From End

The first case we'd have for any deletion would be that the linked-list just does not exist.

That is, the list has no elements in it.

```c
void delete_from_end() {
    if (HEAD == NULL)
        return;
}
```

Simple, right? Now let's move on to a case where we actually have something to delete.

```c
struct Node *temp = HEAD;
while (temp->next->next != NULL) {
    temp = temp->next;
}
```

Remember doing this for our `insert_at_end()`{lang="c"}? Except, we are looking for the second-last node
instead of the last node. Why? Because we are gonna remove the last node.

```c
struct Node *last = temp->next;
temp->next = NULL;
```

In the above code, we are storing the last node's pointer in a different variable and removing
the link from our linked-list.

Now the element is no longer inside the linked-list. But it still stays in the heap. How do we fix that?

```c
free(last);
```

`free()`{lang="c"} is another function from `<stdlib>`{lang="c"} that allows us to free the memory to which our pointer is pointing.

::Alert{type="warning"}
`free()`{lang="c"} is a potentially destructive function. Calling free twice on the same pointer would result in deleting
any new data that happened to be allocated to that memory address (definitely not what you intended to delete). 
::

Our complete function looks like this:

```c
void delete_from_end() {
    if (HEAD == NULL)
        return;
    else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        while (temp->next->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        struct Node *last = temp->next;
        temp->next = NULL;
        free(last);
    }
}
```

### Deletion From Beginning

Deletion from the beginning is much simpler.

```c
void delete_from_beginning() {
    if (HEAD == NULL)
        return;
}
```

It is the same upto this point.

But if the linked-list already has at least one element, we are modifying the connection
as we want.

```c
else {
    struct Node *temp = HEAD;
    HEAD = HEAD->next;
}
```

And of course, a `free()`{lang="c"} call.

Our complete function looks like this:
```c
void delete_from_beginning() {
    if (HEAD == NULL)
        return;
    else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        HEAD = HEAD->next;
        free(temp);
    }
}
```
### Deletion From Custom Position

Assume that our linked-list is a stack of ten legos stacked on top of each other.

Suppose you want to remove the third block, what do you do?
- Remove the fourth and above blocks from the stack.
- Remove the third block.
- Connect the fourth and above blocks with the second block.

In essence, it follows our `insert_at_custom()`{lang="c"} and `delete_from_end()`{lang="c"}.

Our complete function looks like this:

```c
void delete_from_custom(int position) {
    if (HEAD == NULL)
        return;
    struct Node *temp = HEAD;
    int i = 0;
    while (i < position - 1 && temp->next->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
            i += 1;
    }
    struct Node *last = temp->next;
    temp->next = last->next;
    free(last);
}
```

The working is the same as `delete_from_end()`{lang="c"} except that we modify the connections 
in a different way.

## What We Have Now

```c 
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};

struct Node *HEAD;

void insert_at_beginning(int item) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item;
    new_item->next = NULL;
    if (HEAD == NULL) {
        HEAD = new_item;
    } else {
        struct Element *temp = HEAD;
        HEAD = new_item;
        HEAD->next = temp;
    }
}

void insert_at_end(int item) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item;
    new_item->next = NULL;

    if (HEAD == NULL) {
        HEAD = new_item;
    } else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        while (temp->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        temp->next = new_item;
    }
}

void insert_at_custom(int item, int position) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->value = item;
    new_item->next = NULL;
    if (HEAD == NULL) {
        HEAD = new_item;
    } else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        int i = 0; 
        while (i < position && temp->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
            i += 1;
        }
        new_item->next = temp->next;
        temp->next = new_item;
    }
}

void delete_from_end() {
    if (HEAD == NULL)
        return;
    else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        while (temp->next->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        struct Node *last = temp->next;
        temp->next = NULL;
        free(last);
    }
}

void delete_from_beginning() {
    if (HEAD == NULL)
        return;
    else {
        struct Node *temp = HEAD;
        HEAD = HEAD->next;
        free(temp);
    }
}

void delete_from_custom(int position) {
    if (HEAD == NULL)
        return;
    struct Node *temp = HEAD;
    int i = 0;
    while (i < position - 1 && temp->next->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
            i += 1;
    }
    struct Node *last = temp->next;
    temp->next = last->next;
    free(last);
}
```
