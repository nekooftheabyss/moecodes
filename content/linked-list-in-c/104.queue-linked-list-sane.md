# Queue
::Article{type="gray"}
*This article assumes that you have already read [Linked-List in C](/l/c/single-linked-list) and does not provide much explanation.*
::

This article is a sligtly easier approach towards how a queue works, using only ONE pointer, the `FRONT`.

::Article{type="gray"}
*Queue's are supposed to use two pointers for ease of access and to improve operation speed. Using a single pointer will result in slower `enqueue` operation.*
::

## Structure
The structure is the same as a singly linked-list.

```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};
```

And then the head of our queue,
```c 
struct Node *FRONT;
```


## Code
```c
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};

struct Node *FRONT;

// Following the `insert_at_end` algorithm for a singly linked-list
void enqueue(int item_to_insert) {
    struct Node *new_item = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    new_item->data = item_to_insert;
    new_item->next = NULL;

    if (FRONT == NULL) {
        FRONT = new_item;
    } else {
        struct Node *temp = FRONT;
        while (temp->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        temp->next = new_item;
    }
}

void dequeue() {
    if (FRONT == NULL)
        return; // Return in case of empty queue
    else {
        struct Node *temp = FRONT;
        FRONT = FRONT->next;
        free(temp);
    }
}

```
