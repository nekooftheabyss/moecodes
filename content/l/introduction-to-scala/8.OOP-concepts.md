# OOP Concepts in Scala

As mentioned in the introduction, Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.

Like many other object-oriented languages, Scala provides `classes`. In addition, Scala also provides
`traits`.

## Traits

Traits are like `interfaces`, but can also define concrete methods and properties. 

```scala
trait Baddie;
```

### Abstract Methods and Properties

Traits can define abstract members that are required to be implemented
by any subclass.

The following is a simple example of a purely interface-like trait, 
providing only abstract methods:

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala2 Scala3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala2" active}
 ```scala
  trait Pillager {
    val target: String
    def pillage: String
  }
  class Pirate extends Pillager {
    def target = "other ships"
    def pillage = "The pirate pillages " + target 
  }
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala3"}
 ```scala
  trait Pillager:
    val target: String
    def pillage: String
  
  class Pirate extends Pillager:
    def target = "other ships"
    def pillage = "The pirate pillages " + target 
  ```
 :::
::

### Concrete Methods and Properties

Traits can also provide concrete methods and properties, basically members provided
to the subclass by the trait.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala2 Scala3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala2" active}
 ```scala
  trait Pillager {
    val name: String;
    val target = "innocent people"
    def pillage = s"The $name pillages $target"  
  }
  class Bandit extends Pillager {
    val name = "bandit"
  }
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala3"}
 ```scala
  trait Pillager:
    val name: String;
    val target = "innocent people"
    def pillage = s"The $name pillages $target" 

  class Bandit extends Pillager:
    val name = "bandit"
 ```
 :::
::

### Mixin Composition

A class (or trait) can also extend multiple traits to combine multiple behaviors.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala2 Scala3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala2" active}
 ```scala
  trait Pillager {
    val target: String
    def pillage: String
  }
  trait Sailor {
    def sail = "They sail"
  }
  class Pirate extends Pillager with Sailor {
    def target = "other ships"
    def pillage = "The pirate pillages " + target 
  }
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala3"}
 ```scala
  trait Pillager:
    val target: String
    def pillage: String

  trait Sailor:
    def sail = "They sail"
  
  class Pirate extends Pillager, Sailor:
    def target = "other ships"
    def pillage = "The pirate pillages " + target 
  ```
 :::
::

## Classes

Classes are blueprints for objects. They can also extend traits or other classes (or both).

While a class can extend multiple traits, it can only extend one class. It is advisable to
use traits over classes for decomposition.

Let's rewrite our previous example to use only classes.

::CodeGroup{labels="Scala2 Scala3"}
 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala2" active}
 ```scala
  // superclass
  class Pillager(val name: String) {
    val target = "innocent people"
    def pillage = s"The $name pillages $target"  
  }
  // derived subclass
  class Bandit extends Pillager("bandit");
 ```
 :::

 :::CodeBlock{label="Scala3"}
 ```scala
  // superclass
  class Pillager(val name: String):
    val target = "innocent people"
    def pillage = s"The $name pillages $target" 

  // derived subclass
  class Bandit extends Pillager("bandit");
 ```
 :::
::

In this example, `Pillager` is the superclass from which the `Bandit` subclass is derived.

Classes can have a constructor which helps initialize values.
```scala
// Pirate is a class with one parameter, name: String
// The `val` implies that the parameter is stored
// as a property of the Pirate class.
class Pirate(val name: String)

// teach is an instance of Pirate with the name Blackbeard
val teach = new Pirate("Blackbeard")
```
