# Duck Typing

*If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.*

Duck Typing is a programming concept used to determine the type of an object.

- In nominative typing, an object is of a certain type based on the type it is explicitly declared with or the type it is derived from.
- In duck typing, an object is of a certain type if it has all methods and properties of that type.

For example,

```ts
class Triceratops {
    hasTail = true;
}

class Pikachu {
    hasTail = true;
}

// Create a triceratops
item1 = new Triceratops();
// Create a pikachu
item2 = new Pikachu();
// Create an object with hasTail = true
item3 = { 
    hasTail: true 
};
```

Using the duck typing principle, all the three items in the example
are of the same type since they all have a single, mutual property.
