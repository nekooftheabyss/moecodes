# The Scala REPL

Like many modern programming language runtimes, Scala provides a **REPL** (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop)
via the command line that can be accessed through the `scala` command.

```r
$ scala
Welcome to Scala 2.13.8 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 17.0.4.1).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> _ 
```

You can evaluate simple expressions via the REPL.

```r
$ scala
Welcome to Scala 2.13.8 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 17.0.4.1).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> println("Hello World");
Hello World

scala> _
```
