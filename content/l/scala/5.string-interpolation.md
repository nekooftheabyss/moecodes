# String Interpolation in Scala

Strings in scala support a feature called **interpolation** which provides a way to
seamlessly use variables inside a string.

There are three basic interpolators:
- `s`
- `f`
- `raw`

They function similar to JavaScript `tags`.

## The `s` Interpolator

It is a very simple interpolator that just places the variables inside the string.

```scala
val firstName = "Roger";
val middleName = "D.";
val lastName = "Gol";

val fullName = s"I am $lastName $middleName $firstName!";

println(fullName);
// I am Gol D. Roger!
```

But what if we need to use methods inside the string?

```scala
val firstName = "Roger";
val middleName = "d."; // We need to capitalize this
val lastName = "Gol";

val fullName = s"I am $lastName $middleName.toUpperCase $firstName!";

println(fullName);
// I am Gol d..toUpperCase Roger!
```

Definitely not what we wanted. In this case, we can use curly braces to group the entire value.

```scala
val fullName = s"I am $lastName ${middleName.toUpperCase} $firstName!";

println(fullName);
// I am Gol D. Roger!
```

Perfect!

## The `raw` Interpolator

The `raw` interpolator is almost the same as the `s` interpolator, except that
it escapes all special characters like `\n`.

```scala
val name = "Kaido";

val msg1 = s"Hello,\n$name";
println(msg1) 
/*
  Hello,
  Kaido
*/

val msg2 = raw"Hello,\n$name";
println(msg2) 
/*
  Hello,\nKaido
*/
```

## The `f` Interpolator

The `f` interpolator allows the use of format strings (like the ones used in C).

Each variable name should be immediately followed by a format string. 

```scala
val pi = 3.14;

println(f"Pi is $pi%1.0f");  // Pi is 3

println(f"Pi is $pi%1.2f");  // Pi is 3.14

println(f"Pi is $pi%1.9f");  // Pi is 3.140000000
```

The variables must match the data type. The compiler will otherwise
throw an error.

```scala
println(f"Pi is $pi%d");  
/*
    error: type mismatch;
    found   : Double
    required: Int
*/
```
