# How to make a Discord clock bot

![This is supposed to be a banner](/blog/banner/discordclock.webp)

Yes, this is the same banner as before, with just a random extra clock image I found on DuckDuckGo. 

My previous post covered the bare basics of a Discord bot (and I didn't even touch the interactions part). This time, let's see how to make a Discord "clock" bot. 

### What does a clock bot do?
It just monitors a certain voice channel in the server and changes its name to match the time periodically.

## Note
Avoid using "clock bots" tbh. I only made this guide because I've seen too many people asking for such bots. Why do people even want a clock bot? Lazy to do math or lookup a timezone?

## Prerequisites

   * Everything from my previous guide [here](/blog/post/simple-discord-bot#prerequisites).

## Getting started

Now that you have all the prerequisites ready, let us begin making the actual bot.

### Create a new folder
Create a new folder to make your bot in. Make sure it is an empty folder.
### Open the command line.
If you use Windows, this is your command prompt or powershell. If you use GNU Linux, you'd know what a command line is.

Navigate to your folder through

```sh
cd <path-to-your-folder>
```

like

```sh
cd /home/mydumbpc/projects/discord-bot
```

### Install Eris

We will be using Eris for this guide. Why? Because it is simple.

```sh
npm install --save eris
```

This should install Eris in your folder. You should now see a package.json file and a node_modules folder in it.

### Create your main file

* Create a file with a .js extension. Name it whatever you want. For ease of explaining, I'll name mine `coolbot.js`

* Create another file.

* Let's name this config.js.

The content should be

```js
export const TOKEN = 'your discord bot token here'
```

Yes, the token you copied a while ago.

### Messing up package.json a bit

*  Open package.json.
*  Enter the following line above your dependencies line.

```json
"type": "module",
```

* This line makes sure that your program can use stuff like import and export.

## Start coding

### Creating your bot file

Inside your `coolbot.js`,

```js
import { Client } from 'eris'
```

We first import Eris into your bot. Eris is what we use to connect your bot to Discord.

Next, we import the token you saved in `config.js`.

```js
import { TOKEN } from './config.js'
```

Now you have Eris and your token ready. Let's move on to the bot part now.

```js
const myCoolBot = new Client(TOKEN)
```

* Here, we are creating a new "Client", which will be used to connect to Discord. It is similar to how you use the Discord app to access chats and stuff.

* We supply your bot token into this client so that the client can log into your bot's account.

* The final step would be, starting up!

```js
await myCoolBot.connect()
```

With this, your bot can finally connect to discord. But how will you know if your bot successfully connected?

```js
myCoolBot.on('ready', () => {
  console.log('I am alive!')
})
```

With this, when your bot becomes "ready", you will see a "I am alive!" in your console.

```js
import { Client } from 'eris'
import { TOKEN } from './config.js'

const myCoolBot = new Client(TOKEN)

myCoolBot.on('ready', () => {
  console.log('I am alive!')
})

await myCoolBot.connect()
```

### Let's start the bot!

* Open your command line like before, and enter the following:

```sh
node coolbot.js
```

* In your case, replace coolbot.js with whatever you named your bot file as.
* Tada! Your bot is now alive!
* You should see "I am alive!" printed in your console.

### Now the "clock" part

We first need a channel for the bot to work with. Copy the ID of a voice channel in your server.

Go over to `config.js` and add this line:

```js
export const CHANNEL = "channel id here"
```

Enter your channel ID in place of `channel id here`.

Come back to your main file and...

```js
import { TOKEN, CHANNEL } from './config.js'
```

After `myCoolBot.connect()` line, add this.

```js
myCoolBot.editChannel(
  CHANNEL, 
  {
    name: `UTC ${new Date().toUTCString().split(" ")[4]}`
  }
)
```

This makes the bot change the `CHANNEL` channel's name into something like `UTC 12:55:12`.

But this happens only once and the bot doesn't change the channel's name when the time updates. For that, we use a `setInterval`.

```js
setInterval(async () => {
  myCoolBot.editChannel(
    CHANNEL, 
    {
      name: `UTC ${new Date().toUTCString().split(" ")[4]}`
    }
  )
}, 60000)
```

This makes the bot repeat this action every `60000` milliseconds, that is, `60` seconds. Why not lesser? Because it ain't nice to spam these actions.

Now your clock bot works!


## Complete Code

I know 90% of y'all were waiting for this.

```js
import { Client } from 'eris'
import { TOKEN, CHANNEL } from './config.js'

const myCoolBot = new Client(TOKEN)

myCoolBot.on('ready', () => {
  console.log('I am alive!')
})

await myCoolBot.connect()

setInterval(async () => {
  myCoolBot.editChannel(
    CHANNEL, 
    {
      name: `UTC ${new Date().toUTCString().split(" ")[4]}`
    }
  )
}, 60000)
```

## Conclusion

You made a bot. The end. Now keep experimenting with it.
