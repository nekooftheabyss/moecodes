# Create a simple Discord Bot using NodeJS

![This is supposed to be a thumbnail](/blog/banner/discorderis.webp)

Making a Discord bot has a lot of guides everywhere. So why don't I make a guide too? In this guide, we'll be making a Discord bot using a programming language called JavaScript. 

## Disclaimer
This is in no way a guide that would allow you to make a decent public bot. This is barely an introduction to Discord bot development.

## Prerequisites

   * Something you can type code in.
   * A good PC. You could also opt to use something like Heroku or Repl.it but I ain't familiar with those.
   * NodeJS (v12x to support ESM syntax). You can easily install NodeJS on your pc from [https://nodejs.org/en/]. Cool, right?
   * A Discord bot.

### Creating the Discord bot

   * Move over to Discord Developer Portal
   * Click on the "New Application" button on the top right. New Application
   * Give it a good name and a profile pic. Add Details
   * Head over to the bot page. Bot Page
   * Copy the token. Token
   * Also don't forget to invite the bot to your server for testing. The invite URL can be created in the OAuth2 tab under the URL Generator page.

## Getting started

Now that you have all the prerequisites ready, let us begin making the actual bot.

### Create a new folder
Create a new folder to make your bot in. Make sure it is an empty folder.
### Open the command line.
If you use Windows, this is your command prompt or powershell. If you use GNU Linux, you'd know what a command line is.

Navigate to your folder through

```sh
cd <path-to-your-folder>
```

like

```sh
cd /home/mydumbpc/projects/discord-bot
```

### Install Eris

We will be using Eris for this guide. Why? Because it is simple.

```sh
npm install --save eris
```

This should install Eris in your folder. You should now see a package.json file and a node_modules folder in it.

### Create your main file

* Create a file with a .js extension. Name it whatever you want. For ease of explaining, I'll name mine coolbot.js.

* Create another file

* Let's name this token.js.

The content should be

```js
export default 'your discord bot token here'
```

Yes, the token you copied a while ago.

### Messing up package.json a bit

*  Open package.json.
*  Enter the following line above your dependencies line.

```json
"type": "module",
```

* This line makes sure that your program can use stuff like import and export.

## Start coding

### Creating your bot file

Inside your `coolbot.js`,

```js
import Eris from 'eris'
```

We first import Eris into your bot. Eris is what we use to connect your bot to Discord.

Next, we import the token you saved in `token.js`.

```js
import TOKEN from './token.js'
```

Now you have Eris and your token ready. Let's move on to the bot part now.

```js
const myCoolBot = new Eris.Client(TOKEN)
```

* Here, we are creating a new "Client", which will be used to connect to Discord. It is similar to how you use the Discord app to access chats and stuff.

* We supply your bot token into this client so that the client can log into your bot's account.

* The final step would be, starting up!

```js
myCoolBot.connect()
```

With this, your bot can finally connect to discord. But how will you know if your bot successfully connected?

```js
myCoolBot.on('ready', () => {
  console.log('I am alive!')
})
```

With this, when your bot becomes "ready", you will see a "I am alive!" in your console.

```js
import Eris from 'eris'
import TOKEN from './token.js'

const myCoolBot = new Eris.Client(TOKEN)

myCoolBot.on('ready', () => {
  console.log('I am alive!')
})

myCoolBot.connect()
```

### Let's start the bot!

* Open your command line like before, and enter the following:

```sh
node coolbot.js
```

* In your case, replace coolbot.js with whatever you named your bot as.
* Tada! Your bot is now alive!
* You should see "I am alive!" printed in your console.

### Making the bot respond

What use is a bot that does nothing? Clout?

Let's make it do something
Making it respond to messages.

Before your `myCoolBot.connect()` line, add this.

```js
myCoolBot.on('messageCreate', (message) => {
  myCoolBot.createMessage(message.channel.id, 'I see a message')
})
```

This makes your bot respond to every message with a I see a message. Annoying, isn't it?
Let's patch this up a bit

```js
myCoolBot.on('messageCreate', (message) => {
  if (message.content.startsWith('!')) {
    myCoolBot.createMessage(message.channel.id, 'I see a message')
  }
})
```

We made a small change now. The bot only responds to messages that start with a !.
Let's be more precise!

```js
myCoolBot.on('messageCreate', (message) => {
  if (message.content === 'cool bot') {
    myCoolBot.createMessage(message.channel.id, 'I see a message')
  }
})
```

Now your bot only responds to cool bot.
More functions!

```js
myCoolBot.on('messageCreate', (message) => {
  if (message.content === 'cool bot') {
    myCoolBot.createMessage(message.channel.id, 'I see a message')
  } else if (message.content === 'not cool bot') {
    myCoolBot.createMessage(message.channel.id, 'Thats not me!')
  }
})
```

Now your bot responds to two messages! You can do more by adding more else if lines.

```js
myCoolBot.on('messageCreate', (message) => {
  if (message.content === 'cool bot') {
    myCoolBot.createMessage(message.channel.id, 'I see a message')
  } else if (message.content === 'not cool bot') {
    myCoolBot.createMessage(message.channel.id, 'Thats not me!')
  } else if (message.content === 'is it raining?') {
    myCoolBot.createMessage(message.channel.id, 'I do not know!')
  }
})
```

## Complete Code

I know 90% of y'all were waiting for this.

```js
import Eris from 'eris'
import TOKEN from './token.js'

const myCoolBot = new Eris.Client(TOKEN)

myCoolBot.on('ready', () => {
  console.log('I am alive!')
})

myCoolBot.on('messageCreate', (message) => {
  if (message.content === 'cool bot') {
    myCoolBot.createMessage(message.channel.id, 'I see a message')
  } else if (message.content === 'not cool bot') {
    myCoolBot.createMessage(message.channel.id, 'Thats not me!')
  } else if (message.content === 'is it raining?') {
    myCoolBot.createMessage(message.channel.id, 'I do not know!')
  }
})

myCoolBot.connect()
```

## Conclusion

You made a bot. The end. Now keep experimenting with it.
